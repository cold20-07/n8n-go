# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature addresses multiple critical issues in the n8n workflow generator project that are preventing it from functioning correctly. The project has incomplete implementations, missing methods, and potential runtime errors that need to be resolved to ensure proper functionality.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the WorkflowOutputEnhancer class to be fully implemented, so that the n8n workflow generator can properly enhance and format workflow outputs.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the WorkflowOutputEnhancer is instantiated THEN it SHALL have all required methods implemented
2. WHEN create_export_package method is called THEN it SHALL return a properly formatted export package with workflow, filename, and formatted_json
3. WHEN enhance_output method is called THEN it SHALL properly enhance the workflow output with research-based improvements

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the n8n_workflow_research.py file to be complete and functional, so that the workflow generator can leverage real-world n8n patterns.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the N8nWorkflowResearcher class is used THEN it SHALL have all methods properly implemented
2. WHEN _analyze_workflow_structure method is called THEN it SHALL properly analyze workflow patterns
3. WHEN _generate_insights method is called THEN it SHALL return meaningful insights about workflow patterns

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a developer, I want all Python syntax errors and missing imports to be resolved, so that the application can run without runtime errors.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN any Python file is executed THEN it SHALL not raise ImportError or AttributeError exceptions
2. WHEN the Flask application starts THEN it SHALL initialize all components successfully
3. WHEN API endpoints are called THEN they SHALL execute without method-not-found errors

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the build process to work correctly, so that the application can be deployed successfully.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the build script is executed THEN it SHALL complete without file-not-found errors
2. WHEN static assets are copied THEN all required files SHALL be present in the source directories
3. WHEN the application is built THEN all dependencies SHALL be properly resolved

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a user, I want the web interface to function properly, so that I can generate n8n workflows without JavaScript errors.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the web page loads THEN it SHALL initialize the Monaco editor successfully
2. WHEN the generate button is clicked THEN it SHALL make API calls without client-side errors
3. WHEN workflows are generated THEN they SHALL display properly in the interface
