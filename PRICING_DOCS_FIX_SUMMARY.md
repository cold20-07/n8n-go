# Pricing & Documentation Pages Fix - Vercel Deployment

## Problem Identified
After fixing the main UI, the pricing and documentation pages were missing from the Vercel deployment because:

1. **Local development** used Flask routing to serve `templates/pricing.html` and `templates/documentation.html`
2. **Vercel deployment** only had the main `public/index.html` page
3. Navigation links were pointing to Flask routes that don't exist in static deployment

## Solutions Implemented

### 1. Created Static HTML Pages
- **Created**: `public/pricing.html` - Complete pricing page with 3 tiers
- **Created**: `public/documentation.html` - Comprehensive documentation with sidebar navigation
- **Converted**: Flask templates to static HTML with proper asset paths

### 2. Updated Vercel Configuration
- **File**: `vercel.json`
- **Added**: Routes for `/pricing` → `/public/pricing.html`
- **Added**: Routes for `/pricing.html` → `/public/pricing.html`
- **Added**: Routes for `/documentation` → `/public/documentation.html`
- **Added**: Routes for `/documentation.html` → `/public/documentation.html`

### 3. Updated Navigation Links
- **File**: `public/index.html`
- **Changed**: Navigation links to use `.html` extensions for static deployment
- **Updated**: All pages to use consistent navigation structure

### 4. Enhanced Pricing Page Features
- **Design**: Modern glassmorphism cards with hover effects
- **Plans**: 
  - **Starter**: Free tier with basic features
  - **Professional**: $29/month with advanced features (marked as "Most Popular")
  - **Enterprise**: $99/month with premium features
- **Interactive**: Buttons link to main generator or show contact info
- **Responsive**: Mobile-friendly design

### 5. Enhanced Documentation Page Features
- **Structure**: Sidebar navigation with smooth scrolling
- **Sections**:
  - Getting Started (Introduction, Installation, Quick Start)
  - Features (Workflow Builder, Validation, Integrations)
  - API Reference (Overview, Authentication, Endpoints)
- **Content**: Comprehensive guide with code examples
- **Interactive**: Clickable sidebar navigation with active states

## File Structure After Fix

```

└── static/
    ├── css/
    │   └── style.css    # Shared styling

## Vercel Routing Configuration

The `vercel.json` now handles:
- `/pricing` and `/pricing.html` → Pricing page
- `/documentation` and `/documentation.html` → Documentation page
- `/static/*` → Static assets (CSS, JS, images)
- `/api/*` → API endpoints
- `/` → Homepage

## Deployment Process

### Automated Setup
```bash
node deploy-vercel.js  # Verifies all pages and assets
vercel --prod          # Deploy to production
```

### Manual Verification
After deployment, test these URLs:
- `https://your-domain.vercel.app/` - Homepage
- `https://your-domain.vercel.app/pricing.html` - Pricing
- `https://your-domain.vercel.app/documentation.html` - Documentation

## Result

✅ **Professional Pricing**: Three-tier pricing with modern design  
✅ **Comprehensive Docs**: Full documentation with API reference  
✅ **Consistent Design**: All pages match the main UI theme
