  config: { errorMessage: 'Workflow execution failed' }
}
```

#### 2. Data Quality Fixes
```javascript
// Added validation step
{
  node: 'Code (JavaScript)',
  purpose: 'Data validation and cleaning',
  config: { 
    code: 'return $input.all().filter(item => item.json && Object.keys(item.json).length > 0);' 
  }
}
```

#### 3. Performance Fixes
```javascript
// Added after sort operations
{
  node: 'Limit',
  purpose: 'Limit results for performance',
  config: { limit: 100 }
}
```

## 🎯 Recommendations for n8n Development

### 1. **Default Templates Enhancement**
```yaml
Recommended Default Workflow Structure:
- Trigger Node (required)
- Data Validation Node (auto-added)
- Processing Steps (user-defined)
- Error Handling Node (auto-added)
- Integration/Output Nodes (user-defined)
```

### 2. **Validation Rules Implementation**
- **Mandatory Error Handling**: Require error nodes in production workflows
- **Data Validation Prompts**: Suggest validation when processing external data
- **Performance Warnings**: Alert when sorting large datasets without limits

### 3. **Automated Quality Checks**
- **Pre-deployment Validation**: Check for common issues before activation
- **Performance Analysis**: Estimate execution time and resource usage
- **Best Practice Suggestions**: Real-time recommendations during workflow building

### 4. **Template Library Expansion**
Based on successful patterns, create templates for:
- **Form Processing with Validation** (4 nodes, high reliability)
- **Scheduled Data Processing** (6 nodes, medium complexity)
- **Webhook Integration Hub** (8 nodes, complex routing)

## 🔧 Technical Implementation Insights

### Validation System Architecture
