- **40,000 Failure Cases** (20%): Edge cases that may legitimately fail

### Validation Approach
- **Side-by-side comparison** of enhanced vs legacy validation
- **Identical quality criteria** applied to both systems
- **Realistic failure expectations** maintained
- **Production-representative test scenarios**

## 🔧 Enhanced Validation Capabilities

### 1. **Input Recovery & Enhancement**
```
Empty Input: "" → "automated data processing workflow"
Generic Terms: "thing" → "item"
Minimal Input: "a" → "automated a processing workflow"
Type Conversion: 123 → "123"
```

### 2. **Multi-Language Support**
```
Spanish: "flujo de trabajo" → Processed correctly
French: "système workflow" → Processed correctly
Mixed: "システム workflow" → Handled gracefully
```

### 3. **Security & Sanitization**
```
XSS Attempt: "<script>alert('xss')</script>" → Sanitized
SQL Injection: "DROP TABLE users;" → Cleaned
Path Traversal: "../../etc/passwd" → Blocked
```

### 4. **Parameter Normalization**
```
Trigger Types: "http" → "webhook", "cron" → "schedule"
Complexity: "advanced" → "complex", "basic" → "simple"
Invalid Options: Cleaned and validated automatically
```
